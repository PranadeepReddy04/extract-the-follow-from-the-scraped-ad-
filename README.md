Scrapy is a Python framework for large scale web scraping. It gives you all the tools you need to efficiently extract data from websites, process them as you want, and store them in your preferred structure and format.  As diverse the internet is, there is no “one size fits all” approach in extracting data from websites. Many a time ad hoc approaches are taken and if you start writing code for every little task you perform, you will eventually end up creating your own scraping framework. Scrapy is that framework.  With Scrapy you don’t need to reinvent the wheel.
